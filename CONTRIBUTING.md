## Adding an audio sample

Find an audio sample in a known language, and propose that it be added to the index. Good samples are:

- Primarily in one language
- Of a few minutes in length, no more than an hour
- From a known source, so that it can be correctly attributed
- (Ideally) In a language that doesn't yet have much coverage

You can propose an audio sample by opening a [Github issue](https://github.com/larsyencken/wide-language-index/issues) with a link to the page for the sample, making sure to identify its language.

For the tech savvy, feel free to open a pull request directly with a proposed JSON record for the new sample. Be sure your contribution survives a `make audit`.

## Correcting a sample's language

Please raise a [Github issue](https://github.com/larsyencken/wide-language-index/issues) about it.
