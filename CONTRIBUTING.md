# Contributing

In the ideal world, this project is based entirely on community contributions. Your help is most appreciated.

## Adding an audio sample

Find an audio sample in a known language, and propose that it be added to the index. Good samples are:

- Primarily in one language
- Of a few minutes in length, no more than an hour
- From a known source, so that it can be correctly attributed
- (Ideally) In a language that doesn't yet have much coverage

You can propose an audio sample by opening a [Github issue](https://github.com/larsyencken/wide-language-index/issues) with a link to the page for the sample, making sure to identify its language.

For the tech savvy, feel free to open a pull request directly with a proposed JSON record for the new sample. Be sure your contribution survives a `make audit`.

## Correcting a sample's language

Please raise a [Github issue](https://github.com/larsyencken/wide-language-index/issues) about it.

## Annotating samples

As well as contributing sound files, it helps to know which parts of the sound files are ok to use as examples of a language. This is called annotation.

You can contribute an annotation by raising a Github issue, just like for a sample. But, this takes a lot of time. It's much better to do a number at once, using the built-in annotation tool. This section is about using that tool. To begin with, we need to install it.

### Installing the codebase

A built-in console annotation tool is provided for OS X and Linux. The instructions for getting started on OS X are as follows:

Firstly, install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), which will provide the `brew` command.

Next, we need to fetch the index.

```
brew install git
git clone https://github.com/larsyencken/wide-language-index
cd wide-language-index
make env
```

The index just says what media files are available, now we need to get the files themselves.

```
make fetch
```

Now we have the sound files and we're ready to go. Start an annotation session by running:

### Using the annotation tool

You can start an annotation session at any time in the Terminal by going into the `wide-language-index/` directory and running:

```
make annotate
```

The tool will guide you on making annotations. You can stop at any time by pressing CTRL-C.

### Contributing your annotations

You can contribute your annotations back using a Github fork-and-pull workflow. You can [read more](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) about this type of workflow on Github. We'll step you through it here.

Step 1: sign up for [Github](https://github.com). Doing this will get you a username. We'll use _myusername_ as an example from here on out.

Step 2: fork `wide-language-index` on Github. Do this by visiting https://github.com/larsyencken/wide-language-index and clicking the "Fork" button on the top-right.

Step 3: locally commit your changes. In the Terminal, run:

```
cd wide-language-index
git add index
git commit -m 'Made annotations.'
```

Step 4: push your local changes to Github

```
git remote add myusername
git push -u myusername master
```

Step 5: make a pull request in Github. In your web browser, go to https://github.com/myusername/wide-language-index (remember to change _myusername_ for yours). Click the "Make pull request" button, and follow the prompts. Once you've made a pull-request, it will be reviewed and accepted.
